1. An ideal Github graph will need to perform many of the low-level tasks such as retrieve value, filter, compute value, determine range, etc. The higher-level tasks include finding the adjacent nodes (those with links), attribute-based tasks such as highlighting nodes and edges with a specific attribute.

2. 
D3: many more contributors on the branches, branches are relatively small
Jquery: even more contributors. development appears to be done on the main brain (relatively little branching) 
bootstrap: very little development is done on the master branch\

3. The graph structure changes but with the limit to 100 data points, the visualization is still able to behave just fine

4. I would cluster commits together such that not all nodes are single commits.
